# Algorithms

 Sorting Algorithms	- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort	- Sort an array using each (dry run)
- Practice sorting arrays manually
- Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer)
- Quick Sort (Lomuto/Hoare)	- Count Inversions (using Merge Sort)
- Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s (Dutch flag)
4. Searching Algorithms	- Linear Search (brute-force)
- Binary Search (sorted arrays only)
- Iterative & Recursive	- Find an element in array
- Binary Search dry run
- First & last occurrence
- Binary Search on Answer (basic idea)	- Square root of number (using BS)
- Peak element in array (Leetcode Medium)
